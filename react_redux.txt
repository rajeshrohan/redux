subscribe btn : as redux dispatch 
action  : starts from view.
redux   : dispatch -> action -> state. 
react-redux : to link redux state to react state. 
+ provides convient hooks. 

function in react-redux : 
provider : defines where redux is accessible. 
useSelector : access state from react, treats redux state as react state.
useDispatch : change state from anywhere. 

app has to pass many props, to child account, bonus.
this leads to props drilling. 

store can be made in app.js or index.js 

store.getState()    :  get the global state. 


-------------------------------------------------
npm i json-server 

json-server db.json                 -> if installed global
npx json-server db.json             -> if installed local
npx json-server db.json -p 8080     -> dedicated port

-------------------------------------------------
React-Redux : 

we can use the global store, but re-rending of UI will not happen. 
so, to solve this problem , react-redux. 

1. state access 
2. dispatch access
