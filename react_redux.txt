subscribe btn : as redux dispatch 
action  : starts from view.
redux   : dispatch -> action -> state. 
react-redux : to link redux state to react state. 
+ provides convient hooks. 

function in react-redux : 
provider : defines where redux is accessible. 
useSelector : access state from react, treats redux state as react state.
useDispatch : change state from anywhere. 

app has to pass many props, to child account, bonus.
this leads to props drilling. 

store can be made in app.js or index.js 

store.getState()    :  get the global state. 


-------------------------------------------------
npm i json-server 

json-server db.json                 -> if installed global
npx json-server db.json             -> if installed local
npx json-server db.json -p 8080     -> dedicated port

-------------------------------------------------
React-Redux : 
react-redux binds the redux states into react states. 
so, we can directly utilise redux states and UI will re-render again. 
no need of using useState hooks always. 

provides : 
    <Provider>, useSelector, useDispatch

npm i react-redux 

import{Provider} from 'react-redux';    
<Provider store={store}> </Provider>

import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
const amount = useSelector(state => state.account.amount);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

1. Provider component : 
<Provider store={store}> </Provider>

2. useSelector hook : 
provides global state.  
const amount = useSelector(state => state.account.amount);

3. useDispatch hook : 
provides dispatch fn of store.
const dispatch = useDispatch();
